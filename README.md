# Network Class for Touchstone File Processing

A simplified Python class for processing Touchstone files (.snp) representing frequency responses. This project aims to facilitate the processing and visualization of frequency responses, providing an easy-to-use alternative to more powerful tools like ADS Python and scikit-rf.

**Features**

Simple Processing: Perform basic operations such as computing mixed-mode S parameters and de-embedding using T matrix inversion.
Automation via Excel: The main feature of this project is the integration with an Excel file that acts as a control panel, allowing users to automate processes easily.
Visualization: Generate plots for S parameters and mixed-mode S parameters, with options to customize titles and legends based on network names.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib

**Installation**

Clone the repository.
Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the main script to see the example usage.
